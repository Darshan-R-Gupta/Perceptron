# Perceptron
The simplest neural network

This neural network determines the slope of a line and checks whether some set of points exist above it or below it.

The red points indicate that the network "guessed" the point to be above it while 

The green points indicate that the network "guessed" the point to be below it.

Controls:

Press any key to train the network

Press left mouse button to add a point manually to the screen, and the network will guess whether it is above the line or below.
